Events

The integration works through the Home Assistant Event Bus using two event types:
	1.	bang_olufsen_halo_websocket_event_in - Events reported from the Beoremote Halo.
	2.	bang_olufsen_halo_websocket_event_out - Events sent to the Beoremote Halo.

Sending Events to the Beoremote Halo

To send events to the Beoremote Halo, use the bang_olufsen_halo_websocket_event_out event type.
Events must be formatted in YAML and are automatically serialized to JSON.
Include the serial number of your device in the payload.
